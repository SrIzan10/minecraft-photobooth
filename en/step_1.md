By creating the Minecraft photobooth you will learn:

- How to control the Minecraft world with the Python API
- How to find the player's `x`, `y`, and `z` coordinates
- How to use the player's coordinates to trigger the camera module
- How to use functions, `while` loops, and `if` statements in Python

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):

- [Apply abstraction and decomposition to solve more complex problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/developer)
- [Use basic digital, analogue, and electromechanical components](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/creator)
