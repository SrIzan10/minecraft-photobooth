## What you will make
Build a photobooth out of blocks in Minecraft, and program it to take a picture of you (in real life!) when you walk into it.

## What you will learn
By creating the Minecraft photobooth you will learn:

- How to control the Minecraft world with the Python API
- How to find the player's `x`, `y`, and `z` coordinates
- How to use the player's coordinates to trigger the camera module
- How to use functions, `while` loops, and `if` statements in Python
